## Comments are More Useful than You Think 

In some files, I write comments to indicate that, there might be some tactic not being added into the proof relation, because I haven't digested the tests so far yet. It can also be that, the original text has so much ambiguity that unless you comprehend the text, your proof relation might be completely go wrong. If I don't write these comment carefully, the situarion would be worse - and sadly I am not a careful person.

## New Tactic X, Similar Proof Y
I tried to be as carefully as possible when lableing some proof relations that I cannot add currently in the comments, and tactic / similar proof are the most common twos. I can ensure that I label `new tactic` for some proofs involving new unidentified tactics as much as possible. But for `similar proof` the situation is worse. Whenever there could be reasons involving checking the "similar proof" issues in the original texts, it's recommended to examine the original texts throughly, and rely less on the comments in the scripts. There could even be typos typing "similar proof" if it's also a helpful suggestion...
